## Open Science course (2021-2022) 

**Title:** "COMPARISONS OF STUDENT ENGAGEMENT IN UNIVERSITY CLUBS THROUGHOUT COVID-19 PANDEMIC PERIOD"\
**Objectif:** "Measure club-participation numbers at the CRI over the last three years and conduct a time-scale analysis in correlation with the COVID-19 pandemic to see if the student engagement has changed due to the pandemic."\
**Lab:** Open Science, CRI Paris  
**Supervisors:** Bastian Greshake Tzovaras and Ariel Lindner  

## Description
Extracurricular activities are an important part of student life, perhaps impacting many areas, ranging from health and wellbeing to academic performance. The COVID-19 pandemic may have had an impact on students’ participation in university clubs, and subsequently students’ wellbeing and academic engagement. We aim to explore this in our study.
